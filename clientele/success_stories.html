              One of our happy client, Mr. Kantekar, was running a Company,
              Specific Engineering Pvt. Ltd., involved into advanced engineering
              products. The Bank had classified the account as Non Performing
              Asset (NPA) even though it was not eligible for such
              classification. On classification of the account as NPA, the bank
              sold the account to Reliance ARC. Despite having adopted proper
              legal measures by the Promoter of the Company, the ARC oppressed
              and suppressed the law and was threatening and resorting to
              unreasonable recovery mechanisms to repay the dues. The
              Borrower-cum-Promoter had no money for even survival. In such
              circumstances,
              <strong
                >Dr. Visswas and his team guided and helped the client through
                proper legal mechanism safeguarded his properties from the
                aggressive and unreasonable methods and practices adopted by the
                ARC. This gave him tremendous relief and an opportunity to fully
                focus on the revival of his business and stand on his feet for
                his survival. </strong
              >Our client often says Dr. Visswas has given me a rebirth and even
              today seeks all timely guidance for even smallest of business
              decisions that are important and crucial. Dr. Visswas has always
              believed that out of the 4 factors of production, i.e. land,
              labour, capital and enterprise/entrepreneur, whereby
              enterprise/entrepreneur and labour are the only active factors of
              production which have to be utilised to the best of one’s
              capability and ability.
              <strong
                >Even though the ARC has obtained an order for physical
                possession of the mortgaged assets, they cannot execute it. The
                same ARC officers who were ruthlessly treating the client are on
                back footing and will have to compromise in settlement. That
                would mean profit in loss for our client.</strong
              >Here, it is important to note that every borrower turns to be a
              defaulter post NPA, but it is important to differentiate between
              defaulter by circumstances but having good intention to repay
              vis-à-vis a defaulter who is an intentional/ wilful defaulter.

          <ul>
            <p>
              Consolidated Dynamics Pvt. Ltd. was a company having credit
              facilities from the bank from the year 2010. The promoters were
              engaged in manufacture of specific electrical equipment and
              ancillary electrical panels. During the time the company was in
              operations, the company was a reputed brand in its area of
              operation. However, due to the global turmoil and economic
              downtrend, the company faced lack of demand in the manufacturing
              facility as it was underutilized. The promoters desperately tried
              to work out various alternatives but failed as the overall sector
              was in dilemma. During this period, since the promoter was not in
              a position to fulfil its interest obligation towards the banker,
              instead of restructuring and helping the promoter, who was a
              genuine borrower, the banker declared the account of the promoter
              as NPA. This declaration of account as NPA freezed the banking
              facility, which always plays a pivotal role in any business. The
              survival of the company, the people working in the company all
              came to a standstill and in question. During this period, the
              promoter of the company approached Dr. Visswas to help him. Dr.
              Visswas meticulously understood and guided him at each and every
              step at how to survive in the crisis of NPA and not only
              safeguarded his property but also made the bank realize that by
              coercive recovery or just stopping the business, the bank is also
              causing loss to the borrower as well as eroding its capital.
              <strong>
                Dr. Visswas and his team brought the bankers and the borrower at
                a common platform of settlement whereby not only the account of
                the borrower was settled at 50% of principal borrowings but
                despite being a defaulter in repayment of the dues, the banker
                cooperated and extended all possible help under the provisions

              Association and also on several platforms has time and again
              emphasized that the replacement cost of an existing unit is far
              beyond the revival cost of a present unit as it is always not the
              asset value but the enterprise value.

          <hr class="mt-3 mb-4" style="border: 2px solid red; width: 50px" />
          <ul>
            <p>
              One of our happy clients was M/s. Vishal Malleables Ltd., an
              established foundry industry from the year 1977. The company was
              solely banking with a public sector bank for over more than 4
              decades and did not have a single day of default in any of its
              obligations. However, due to serious downtrend in market
              operations, demand and slowdown in auto sector, the account of the
              company became NPA in 2013. Soon after the declaration of the
              account as NPA, the same borrower to whom the bankers gave red
              carpet treatment started terming them as defaulter and took
              coercive recovery action to recover the dues of the bank despite
              availability of adequate securities. The promoter of the company
              from an Article in Economic Times about Dr. Visswas approached Dr.
              Visswas to help him in this crisis. As our publications rightly
              speak “your guide in crisis”, the promoter of the company got a
              ray of hope that he will be able to survive, he will be able to do
              business and he will be able to repay his banking obligation after
              meeting Dr. Visswas.
              <strong>
                The same promoter whose properties were about to be sold by the
                bankers by taking physical possession and coercive threatening
                steps were not only safeguarded by Dr. Visswas and his team by
                applying proper legal mechanism, but Dr. Visswas was
                instrumental in helping the promoters enter into a 1-time
                settlement/compromise settlement with their bankers, that too
                with the payment terms in a phased manner so that the
                borrower/promoter can sell his assets in a phased manner and
                repay the banker.
              </strong>
              The promoter of the company always used to say that Dr. Visswas is
              the actual doctor because if the company runs and the people and
              stakeholders of the company are happy, then the promoter need not
              take any heart medicine. At NPA Consultants, it is not only the
              problem of the company but the representatives and team of Dr.
              Visswas go one step further in understanding all problems of the
              clients and try to provide the best possible solution as at NPA
              Consultants we firmly understand that the promoter coming to us is
              already in problem, it is we who can provide him with appropriate
              oxygen which will let him breathe and live with his problems.
              Multiple litigations including Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, DRT,
              DRAT, High Court that were faced by this company were roadmap to
              resolve by Dr. Visswas.

          <ul>
            <p>
              GGS Infrastructures Pvt. Ltd is one of the unique case that was
              resolved under the expert leadership of Dr. Visswas was. This
              company was a pioneer and a well-established brand in heavy duty
              fillings all over the country. The company had a fleet size of
              more than 120 cranes involved into road construction, EPC
              infrastructure development and also port expansions. During the
              global turmoil when the entire economy was diminishing and
              undergoing a downtrend, on the one hand where the infrastructure
              segment was badly affected, on the other hand the companies
              engaged into activities associated with infrastructure started
              bleeding. Huge infrastructure companies like Hindustan
              Construction Company and big shipyard companies like ABG and
              Bharati Shipyard including structural designing companies like
              major structural joints in India were all in doldrums. Due to the
              severe adverse market condition, the account of this company too
              became NPA.
            </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>
              The promoter of the company had a legacy of always delivering the
              best and had a firm commitment towards the business. They believed
              in the philosophy of simple living and high thinking, but when the
              bank account of the company got classified as Nonperforming Asset,
              the banker started giving the same draconian treatment to the
              company and the promoters by stopping the business and freezing
              all the bank accounts. Dr. Visswas has always believed that
              whenever the account of the company becomes NPA, the borrower
              needs time to put its business on track and repay its obligation
              to the banker rather than fresh money or capital alone. Due to the
              pessimistic approach of the bankers and the deficiencies in the
              system designed to govern the banking system, a theory of once a
              defaulter always a defaulter comes into existence and a borrower
              who has tremendous future potential for growth and prosperity is
              completely destroyed.
            </p>
            <b>
              During this period of turmoil in this company, Dr. Visswas not
              only safeguarded all the cranes from getting sold at an aggressive
              distress value by the banker, but also guided the promoters of
              alternative mechanisms to run the business and re-establish
              themselves. During the same period, there was an introduction of
              Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and taking appropriate measures,
              the promoters on the guidance of Dr. Visswas filed an application
              under Section 10 of the IBC before National Company Law Tribunal.
              After detailed representation and argument, the Petition of the
              company got admitted and after due resolution process by building
              appropriate comfort and by bringing its stakeholder on a common
              platform including the banker and the Resolution Professional, Dr.
              Visswas was instrumental in the resolution of the account of the
              company whereby despite aggressive declaration of wilful defaulter
              of the account by the banker, the banker not only approved the
              resolution plans, but today the promoter has repaid its obligation
              to the banker and restarted its own business.
            </b>
            <p></p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Each activity was monitored by Dr. Visswas and his team and we at
              NPA Consultants were available 24 x 7 during the entire crisis
              phase faced by the client. This is a unique case in the history of
              IBC whereby not only the bankers were satisfied by the resolution,
              but the borrower who was completely shattered and felt dejected in
              life, today has restarted the business. Dr. Visswas always
              believed and has spoken at various platforms that by closure of
              one business, it is not one business or family that is affected
              but the peripheral loss is of all dependents directly and
              indirectly on that particular business.
            </p>
            <p>
              To kill the business, it takes just one declaration as
              Nonperforming Asset of an account, but to create a business and to
              make it profitable, it takes years and generations of hard work.

            2016, there were several cases that got admitted for Corporate
